## Week 1: Fundamentals

### Day 1: Two Sum
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Arrays, HashMap

**Problem:**  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of two numbers that add up to target.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1] (nums[0] + nums[1] = 9)
```

**Constraints:**
- Each input has exactly one solution
- Can't use same element twice

**Hints:**
- Use HashMap to store seen numbers
- Look for complement (target - current)

---

### Day 2: Valid Parentheses
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Stack

**Problem:**  
Given string containing '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']', determine if valid.

**Example:**

Output: true

Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
```
