## 📝 Quick Reference

### Essential Patterns

**Singleton Pattern**:
```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]
```

**Context Manager**:
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timer(name: str):
    start = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        print(f"{name}: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")
```

**Async Rate Limiter**:
```python
from asyncio import Semaphore

semaphore = Semaphore(10)  # Max 10 concurrent

async def limited_request(url):
    async with semaphore:
        return await fetch(url)
```

### Security Checklist

Before every deployment:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Parameterized SQL queries
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enforced
- [ ] Dependencies scanned
- [ ] SAST/DAST passed
- [ ] Container images scanned
- [ ] Authentication enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Logging configured properly

### Performance Optimization

Common optimizations:
- [ ] Use sets for membership testing (O(1) vs O(n))
- [ ] Use join() for string concatenation
- [ ] Implement generators for large datasets
- [ ] Add @lru_cache to pure functions
- [ ] Use async for I/O operations
- [ ] Batch database queries
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
