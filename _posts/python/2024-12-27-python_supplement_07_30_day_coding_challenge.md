# Python Mastery - 30-Day Coding Challenge

**Daily coding challenges to build muscle memory**

## Challenge Structure
- **Week 1**: Fundamentals (strings, lists, dicts)
- **Week 2**: Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
- **Week 3**: Data structures (stacks, queues, trees)
- **Week 4**: System design (mini-projects)

## Daily Format
- 1 problem per day (30-60 min)
- Multiple solutions (brute force → optimal)
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Code review next day

## Week 1: Fundamentals

**Day 1**: Two Sum  
Input: [2,7,11,15], target=9  
Output: [0,1]

**Day 2**: Valid Anagram  
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"  
Output: true

**Day 3**: Group Anagrams  
Input: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]  
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

[Days 4-30 continue in full version...]
